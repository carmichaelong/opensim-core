/** This Measure operator returns the time derivative of its operand measure,
or a numerical approximation of the time derivative if an analytic one is not
available.

If the operand measure provides its own derivative measure, then the value of 
the Differentiate operator is just the value of the operand's derivative 
measure, and this measure will have one fewer available derivatives than does 
the operand. If the operand does not have a derivative, then we will estimate 
it by the following method:
    - retrieve the previous value f0 and previous derivative fdot0 of the 
      operand measure, and their sample time t0
    - obtain the current value f(t) of the operand
    - estimate fdot(t)=2(f-f0)/(t-t0) - fdot0  (fit a quadratic)
    - record new samples f(t), fdot(t) with timestamp t

Special cases:
    - if t==t0 then fdot(t)=fdot0 (if available) else fdot(t)=0
    - if fdot0 not available, fdot(t)=(f-f0)/(t-t0) (first order estimate)

At initialization of a timestepping study beginning at t=t0, we sample the 
operand and record its initial value f0 at t0, and set fdot0=NaN. This
ensures that we'll return zero as the initial derivative (for lack of anything 
better) and then use the first order method for the first step's derivative.

/**
 * This Measure tracks the minimum value attained by its source operand
 * since the last initialize() call. If the time derivative of the 
 * source operand is available, the measure will arrange to ensure
 * precise isolation of the minimum values by defining a triggered 
 * event that watches for negative-to-positive sign changes of the derivative.
 * Then if you output reporting data upon the occurrence of triggered
 * events (as well as your regularly scheduled output) your data will
 * include the precise minimum (to within a specifiable isolation time window).
 *
 * Information available from this Measure:
 *  - the current value (at the source's stage)
 *  - the value at the start of the current step (Time stage)
 *  - time of last change
 *  - the DiscreteVariableIndex holding the previous value
 *  - the CacheEntryIndex designated for the current/next value
 *  - a reference to the source Measure
 *
 * And if a source derivative is available
 *  - the EventId of the minimum-trapping event if there is one
 *  - the time derivative of the Minimum measure
 *  - a reference to the source derivative Measure
 *
 * The time derivative fdot of f(t)=min_t0_t(s(t')) where s is the
 * source measure and t0 <= t' <= t is
 * <pre>
 *      fdot(t) = s(t) < f(ti) && sdot(t) < 0 ? sdot(t) : 0
 * </pre>
 * where ti is the time at the start of the current step.
 *
 * At the start of a continuous interval, the updated value (if any)
 * replaces the stored value.
